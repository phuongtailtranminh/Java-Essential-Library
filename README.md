### Apache Commons
"The Apache Commons Lang 3 library provides support for manipulation of core classes of the Java APIs. This support includes methods for handling strings, numbers, dates, concurrency, object reflection and more.

In addition to providing a general introduction to the library, this tutorial demonstrates methods of two of the most commonly used classes, namely ArrayUtils and StringUtils. ArrayUtils is used for operations on arrays, while StringUtils is used for manipulation of String instances." - BaelDung

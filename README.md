### Apache Commons

"The Apache Commons Lang 3 library provides support for manipulation of core classes of the Java APIs. This support includes methods for handling strings, numbers, dates, concurrency, object reflection and more.

In addition to providing a general introduction to the library, this tutorial demonstrates methods of two of the most commonly used classes, namely ArrayUtils and StringUtils. ArrayUtils is used for operations on arrays, while StringUtils is used for manipulation of String instances." - BaelDung

### Google Guava

"Guava is a set of core libraries that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, functional types, an in-memory cache, and APIs/utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, reflection, string processing, and much more!

Requires JDK 1.8 or higher. If you need support for JDK 1.6 or Android, use 20.0 for now. In the next release (22.0) we will begin providing a backport for use on Android and lower JDK versions."
